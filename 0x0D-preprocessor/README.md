There are essentially three uses of preprocessor-
directives
macros
constants.
0-object_like_macro.h - Defines a macro named SIZE
1-pi.h - Creates a macro file that holds the constant for PI
2-main.c -This program prints the name of the file it was compiled from
3-function_like_macro.h -holds macro function to return absolute value of a number.
4-sum.h  - This file holds a macro like funcion to sum numbers.
